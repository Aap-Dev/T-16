# TiMPLESt-asm
TiMPLEST in Assembly Language

# Origin

One evening I was working on TiMPLEST (regular evening) when it hit me.

I just dont enjoy working on TiMPLEST anymore.

Why? Because TiMPLEST was created in C++ and I just dont enjoy working in that language.

So I took TiMPLEST back to it's roots and coded a fully functional version (including TSHeLL!) in 16 bit assembly and realised this is what i love about osdev!


# Features
Keyboard input

TSHeLL

A terminal write function

# TODO
Make it look nicer

Create filesystem drivers

Start working on implementing TiMPLESTs old design (everything is an app)

Create many more aplications and features

32 bit?

A gui?
